## Features

### üîë Magic Link Authentication
Users can log in securely with a magic link sent to their email. This eliminates the need for passwords, making the authentication process simpler and more secure.

### üë• Social Login
Users can sign up or log in using their social accounts. This includes integration with:
- Google
- GitHub
- Discord

### üõ°Ô∏è Users Roles and Protected Routes
Different user roles (e.g., admin, user) are implemented. The application uses role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access specific routes and functionalities based on their assigned role.

### üí≥ Subscriptions and Billing with Stripe Integration
This project supports recurring payments and subscriptions via Stripe. Users can manage their billing and subscriptions seamlessly within the app.

### üì§ Single/Multipart File Uploading with S3 Storage
Users can upload single or multipart files. These files are stored securely in cloud storage solutions like Cloudflare R1 and Backblaze B2, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### üì± Web and Native iOS/Android Applications
The project is designed to work across multiple platforms, including a web application and native mobile applications for iOS and Android, using Expo for React Native.

### üìß Automated Marketing/Transactional Emails
The project integrates with AWS SES, Resend, and React Email for sending automated marketing emails, transactional emails, and notifications to users.

### üîå tRPC API
We use tRPC for building type-safe APIs, allowing seamless integration between the frontend and backend while maintaining full TypeScript safety.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is implemented to protect the system from abuse and to ensure fair usage of the API endpoints.
